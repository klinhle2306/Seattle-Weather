# DATA 3320 Class Project
1. Description: This data look show the record of rain in Seattle, Washington and St. Louis, Missouri from 2017 to 2022. Below is the data sources.
2. Data: This data set showcase the daily precipitation measured in Seattle and St. Louis from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2022. The data sets were downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information NOAA Climate https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND.
3. The data sets seattle_rain.csv and stl_rain.csv can be accessed from the Github repository for DATA 3320 in the weather folder.

  STL Rain: https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-3320/blob/87e2c1a561ab4364364cfe2fd5d1e6578c147153/weather/stl_rain.csv

4. Data Preperation: This is the process of identifying missing values and imputing datas, thus create a clean version of the dataset. The process includes joining datasets to identify missing values, an algorithm is performed to impute data using the average of the precipitation of the days in the years. The dataset is also put in a tidy format for better readibility.

5. Data Analysis: This is the process of analyzing the cleaned data to answer the question of whether Seattle rains more than St. Louis. Three sub-questions was posted to help provide a more detailed lense into the data. The three questions are:

     1. How many days in a year does it rain in Seattle and St. Louis?
     2. What is the frequency distribution of daily precipitation in Seattle and St. Louis?
     3. How has the average monthly precipitation in Seattle and St. Louis changed over the years?

From the three questions, we can conclude that Seattle experience more rain than St. Louis. We can also notice a seasonal pattern in which Seattle rains more in the Fall and Winter months whereas St. Louis rains more evenly throughout the year. In addition, St. Louis also expereince more dry days compare to Seattle. Even though St. Louis's rainy days are more evenly distributed, Seattle still has more rainy days; therefore Seattle rains more than St. Louis.
